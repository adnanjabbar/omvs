# Open Medical Vocabulary Schema (OMVS)

OMVS is a clinician-led, open-source medical vocabulary and language normalization framework
designed for medical transcription, structured reporting, and AI-assisted clinical documentation.

Unlike proprietary dictation vocabularies, OMVS is open, auditable, specialty-aware,
and designed to be safely integrated into modern AI systems.
