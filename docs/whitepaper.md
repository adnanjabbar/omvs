# Open Medical Vocabulary Schema (OMVS)
## A Clinician-Led Framework for Medical Language Intelligence

### Abstract
Medical language remains fragmented across specialties, vendors, and AI systems. 
OMVS addresses this by providing an open, structured, and specialty-aware medical vocabulary 
designed for transcription, clinical documentation, and AI-assisted healthcare systems.

### Problem Statement
- Medical dictation systems rely on proprietary vocabularies
- AI models hallucinate or misuse medical terminology
- Specialty-specific context is often lost
- Interoperability between systems is poor

### Solution
OMVS introduces:
- A normalized schema for medical terms
- Explicit specialty separation
- Context-aware abbreviation resolution
- Structured reporting templates
- Rule-based clinical safety constraints

### Core Design Principles
- Clinician-first, not vendor-first
- Open and auditable
- Specialty-aware
- AI-compatible but AI-agnostic
- Safe for clinical environments

### Current Coverage (v1.0)
- Family Medicine
- Radiology
- Emergency Medicine
- Internal Medicine
- Cardiology
- Urology

### Use Cases
- Medical transcription engines
- AI clinical note generation
- Radiology and ultrasound reporting
- Academic research and NLP benchmarking

### Governance
OMVS is governed by an open, clinician-led contribution model with explicit versioning, 
changelogs, and specialty ownership.

### Conclusion
OMVS lays the foundation for a shared medical language layer that can safely power 
the next generation of clinical AI systems.
